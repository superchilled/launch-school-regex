# Exercise 9

## Question

Write a regex that matches lines of text that contain at least 3, but no more than 6, consecutive comma separated numbers. You may assume that every number on each line is both preceded by and followed by a comma. Test your regex against these strings:

```
,123,456,789,123,345,
,123,456,,789,123,
,23,56,7,
,13,45,78,23,45,34,
,13,45,78,23,45,34,56,
```

There should be 3 matches.

## Answer

```
/^,(\d+,){3,6}$/
```
